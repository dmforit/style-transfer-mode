\frametitle{Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Revisit and implement the Restorable Arbitrary Style Transfer (RAST) framework.
    \item Conduct an ablation study to evaluate the significance of various loss components.
    \item Introduce an idempotency loss to enforce consistent style transfer behavior.
    \item Adapt the multirestoration loss for low-resolution images to maintain visual fidelity.
    \item Explore architectural simplifications to enhance model efficiency without compromising performance.
    \item Provide insights and recommendations for future improvements in arbitrary style transfer techniques.
\end{itemize}
